# Resend Domain Verification Setup

## üö® Critical: Domain Verification Required

Your email isn't sending because `@crewresourcemining.com.au` needs to be verified in Resend.

## Setup Steps:

### 1. Login to Resend Dashboard
- Go to [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
- Click "Add Domain"

### 2. Add Your Domain
- Enter: `crewresourcemining.com.au`
- Select "Send emails from this domain"

### 3. DNS Records to Add
Resend will provide these DNS records to add to your domain:

**SPF Record:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
```

**DKIM Record:**
```
Type: TXT  
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: [provided by Resend]
```

**DMARC Record (Optional but recommended):**
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@crewresourcemining.com.au
```

### 4. Verify Domain
- Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
- Click "Verify" in Resend dashboard
- Status should show "Verified"

## Alternative: Use Resend Test Domain (Immediate)

For immediate testing, use Resend's test domain:

```env
FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Test domain emails may go to spam and have limitations.
