## üéÆ Scenario Flow

### **Opening Context**
Jake, a loader operator, reports a near-miss collision with a haul truck. As the shift supervisor, your responses will either build a learning culture or reinforce a blame culture.

### **Decision Points (6 total)**

#### **1. Initial Response (Tone-Setting)**
*Your first words set the culture.*

**Options:**
- A: Blame ("Why weren't you paying attention?") ‚Üí 15 points
- B: Just Culture ("Thank you for reporting") ‚Üí 95 points
- C: Normalize ("These things happen") ‚Üí 30 points

**Teaching Point:** Psychological safety begins with the leader's response. Punitive reactions silence future reporting.

---

#### **2. Investigation Approach**
*How do you investigate?*

**Options:**
- A: Interview Jake alone ‚Üí 50 points
- B: Systems investigation (team, procedures, logs, environment) ‚Üí 95 points
- C: Report to management first (CYA) ‚Üí 25 points

**Teaching Point:** Human error is a symptom, not the root cause. Look at the whole system.

---

#### **3. Root Cause Identification (Swiss Cheese Model)**
*Investigation reveals: dust, missed radio check, schedule pressure, sight line degradation, late shift start*

**Options:**
- A: "Jake and HT driver failed protocol" ‚Üí 20 points
- B: "Multiple systemic failures aligned" ‚Üí 100 points
- C: "Bad timing, wrong place/time" ‚Üí 10 points

**Teaching Point:** James Reason's Swiss Cheese Model - incidents require multiple system failures to align. Active errors alone don't cause disasters.

**Aviation Reference:** Every crash investigation looks for latent organizational failures, not just pilot actions.

---

#### **4. Team Communication**
*26 operators at morning briefing*

**Options:**
- A: Formal warning to Jake as example ‚Üí 5 points
- B: Thank Jake publicly, share findings, announce improvements ‚Üí 100 points
- C: Keep it quiet to avoid regulatory attention ‚Üí 0 points

**Teaching Point:** Public reinforcement of reporting builds site-wide psychological safety. Public punishment destroys it.

**Aviation Reference:** Tenerife disaster - 583 died because First Officer feared challenging Captain.

---

#### **5. Corrective Actions**
*Operations manager asks: "What are we fixing?"*

**Options:**
- A: Verbal warning: "Follow protocol or else" ‚Üí 15 points
- B: Proximity alarms + sight line redesign + protocol revision + schedule buffer ‚Üí 100 points
- C: No changes, procedures are adequate ‚Üí 5 points

**Teaching Point:** Defense in depth. Multiple barriers address multiple failure modes. Systemic fixes prevent recurrence.

**Aviation Reference:** "Fly better" ‚Üí Redesign cockpits, procedures, and systems.

---

#### **6. Psychological Safety Reinforcement**
*Jake asks: "Am I... is everything okay?"*

**Options:**
- A: "Don't let it happen again" ‚Üí 20 points
- B: "You made us safer. Keep speaking up." ‚Üí 100 points
- C: "Yeah, all good. Be more careful." ‚Üí 40 points

**Teaching Point:** Close the loop. Show reporters their courage creates change. Psychological safety requires visible impact.

## üéñÔ∏è Outcomes

### **Excellence (80%+): Just Culture Champion**
- **Message:** You demonstrated exceptional understanding of HF principles
- **KPI Results:** All "Excellent"
- **Key Lessons:**
  - Just Culture starts with leader response
  - Swiss Cheese Model: multiple failures align
  - Psychological safety is fragile‚Äînurture it
  - Systemic solutions prevent recurrence
  - Near-misses reveal system weaknesses before tragedy

### **Building (70-79%): Building Foundations**
- **Message:** Good instincts, room to strengthen just culture principles
- **KPI Results:** "Developing" to "Moderate"
- **Key Lessons:**
  - Every interaction builds or erodes psychological safety
  - Look beyond "who" to "why"‚Äîsystems over individuals
  - Close the loop: show reporters their impact
  - One punitive response undoes months of trust

### **Needs Improvement (<70%): Blame Culture Risk**
- **Message:** Review foundational CRM principles
- **KPI Results:** "Needs Improvement" to "At Risk"
- **Key Lessons:**
  - Blame cultures silence reporting. Silence kills.
  - Individual blame ignores systemic causes
  - Aviation learned: punitive cultures hide risks until catastrophe
  - Swiss Cheese Model: incidents require multiple failures

## üéì Aviation CRM Principles Taught

### **1. Just Culture**
- Accountability for choices, learning from outcomes
- Differentiate: honest mistakes vs. reckless violations
- Create psychological safety for reporting

### **2. Systems Thinking (James Reason's Swiss Cheese Model)**
- Active errors (what people do)
- Latent failures (how systems allow errors to align)
- Defense in depth (multiple barriers)

### **3. Psychological Safety (Amy Edmondson)**
- People feel safe to speak up
- Leader response is critical
- Fragile and requires constant nurturing

### **4. Reporting Culture**
- Encourage near-miss reporting
- Close the loop: show impact
- Public reinforcement of reporting courage

### **5. Learning Culture**
- Transform failures into improvements
- Systems analysis over individual blame
- Visible corrective actions

## üèóÔ∏è Real-World Aviation Disasters Referenced

### **Tenerife (1977) - 583 deaths**
- **Cause:** First Officer hesitated to challenge Captain about takeoff clearance
- **Lesson:** Steep authority gradients prevent safety reporting
- **CRM Response:** Flatten hierarchies, encourage upward communication

### **Challenger (1986) - 7 deaths**
- **Cause:** Engineers raised concerns about O-rings, management silenced them
- **Lesson:** Cover-up cultures persist until they kill
- **CRM Response:** Just Culture protects those who speak up

### **Columbia (2003) - 7 deaths**
- **Cause:** Foam strikes normalized over time, treated as non-events
- **Lesson:** Normalization of deviance leads to catastrophe
- **CRM Response:** Every near-miss is investigated systematically

## üí° Pedagogical Design

### **Why This Works**

1. **Immediate Relevance:** Mining scenario learners can relate to
2. **Branching Paths:** Choices matter, consequences are visible
3. **Aviation Credibility:** References disasters learners know
4. **Emotional Impact:** Jake's vulnerability creates empathy
5. **Systems Focus:** Moves beyond individual blame naturally
6. **Visible Learning:** Each decision teaches a specific concept
7. **Repetition:** Key concepts reinforced across 6 decisions

### **Difficulty Progression**

- **Beginner-friendly:** No prior CRM knowledge required
- **Scaffolded:** Concepts build on each other
- **Feedback-rich:** Every choice explains the "why"
- **Real consequences:** Learners see culture impact

---

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Scoring Logic**
- 6 decisions √ó avg score = total score
- Each decision has 3 choices with pre-defined scores
- Multiple paths converge to 3 outcomes
- KPI scores aggregated across all decisions

### **Branching Structure**
```
d1 ‚Üí n2_blame / n2_learning / n2_neutral
     ‚Üì
d2 (all paths converge)
     ‚Üì
d3 ‚Üí n4
     ‚Üì
d4 ‚Üí n5
     ‚Üì
d5 ‚Üí n6
     ‚Üì
d6 ‚Üí o_excellence / o_building / o_needs_improvement
```
