## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
# Database (Neon PostgreSQL recommended)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host/database?sslmode=require"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://user:password@host/database?sslmode=require"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="generate-with: openssl rand -base64 32"

# App URL (for email links)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://yourdomain.com"

# Email (Resend - free tier: 3,000 emails/month, $10/mo for 50k)
RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Cron Security (for automated email reminders)
CRON_SECRET="generate-with: openssl rand -base64 32"
```

---

## Step-by-Step Deployment (Vercel Recommended)

### 1. Database Setup (Neon)

1. Create account at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) (free tier available)
2. Create new project in Sydney region
3. Copy connection strings to `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL`
4. Run database migration:

```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Email Setup (Resend)

1. Create account at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Add and verify your domain (or use `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing)
3. Create API key and add to `RESEND_API_KEY`
4. Update `FROM_EMAIL` in `.env` to match your verified domain

**Email templates included:**
- Welcome email with course enrollment
- Expiry reminders (90, 60, 30, 14, 7, 3, 1 day intervals)
- Certificate issuance with PDF download link
- Incident scenario notifications

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

**Important:** Add all environment variables in Vercel dashboard under "Environment Variables"

### 4. Configure Cron Jobs

The `vercel.json` file is pre-configured to run expiry reminders daily at 9 AM:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/expiry-reminders",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

Add `CRON_SECRET` to Vercel environment variables. The cron endpoint is secured and will only run with the correct Bearer token.

**Cron schedule format:**
- `0 9 * * *` = Daily at 9 AM UTC
- `0 */6 * * *` = Every 6 hours
- `0 0 * * 0` = Weekly on Sunday at midnight

### 5. Seed Initial Data

Run the seed script to create organizations, sites, crews, and sample users:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

**Default Admin Login:**
- Email: `admin@crewresourcemining.com.au`
- Password: (set during seed or create via signup)

---

## Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Organization Setup

Navigate to `/admin/settings` and configure:

- **Certificate validity:** 6 or 12 months
- **Reminder schedule:** 30, 60, 90 days before expiry
- **Sequential module completion:** Required or optional
- **Branding:** Primary color, logo URL

### 2. Site & Crew Setup

Navigate to `/admin/sites` to add:

- Mining sites (Open Pit, Underground, Processing Plant, etc.)
- Crews with shift assignments (Day, Night, Swing, Roster-based)
- Supervisor assignments for each crew

### 3. Bulk User Import

Navigate to `/admin/users/import` and:

1. Download CSV template
2. Fill with user data (email, name, jobTitle, employeeId, siteId, crewId, role)
3. Upload CSV
4. System will auto-enroll and send welcome emails

**CSV Format:**
```csv
name,email,jobTitle,employeeId,department,siteId,crewId,role,courseId,sendWelcomeEmail
John Smith,john.smith@example.com,Haul Truck Operator,EMP001,Mining Operations,SITE_UUID,CREW_UUID,LEARNER,COURSE_UUID,true
```

### 4. Incident-Driven Learning Setup

To convert incidents into training scenarios:

1. Navigate to `/admin/incidents`
2. Click "Report New Incident"
3. Fill ICAM investigation fields:
   - Root cause
   - Contributing factors
   - Corrective actions
   - Key lessons
   - KPI areas affected
4. Click "Generate Scenario"
5. System auto-creates narrative, decision points, and outcomes
6. Publish scenario to assign to affected crews

**Aviation Best Practice:** Airlines convert every incident into mandatory training within 30 days. The system automates this process.

## Integration Options

### Existing Systems

**Incident Management (Cority, Intelex, Gensuite):**
- API webhook to auto-create scenarios from incidents
- Bi-directional sync (training completion → incident system)

**HR Systems (Workday, SAP SuccessFactors):**
- CSV import/export for user provisioning
- SSO integration via NextAuth (SAML, OAuth)

**SCORM Export:**
- Coming in Phase 5
- Allows scenarios to run in existing LMS platforms

### API Endpoints (for custom integrations)

```bash
# Create enrollment
POST /api/admin/enrollments
Body: { userId, courseId }

# Get user compliance status
GET /api/admin/users/{userId}/compliance

# Export compliance report
GET /api/admin/reports/compliance-summary?format=csv

# Verify certificate

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Checks

Monitor these endpoints:
- `/api/health` - Database connection
- `/api/cron/expiry-reminders` - Cron job status (requires CRON_SECRET)

### Email Deliverability

Check Resend dashboard for:
- Bounce rate (should be <2%)
- Open rate (target 40-60% for welcome emails)
- Click rate (target 20-30% for expiry reminders)

**Common issues:**
- SPF/DKIM not configured → verify domain in Resend
- Emails in spam → ask clients to whitelist `noreply@yourdomain.com`
- Expired API key → rotate in Resend dashboard

### Database Backups

Neon automatically backs up every 24 hours. For mission-critical deployments:
- Enable Point-in-Time Restore (PITR)
- Set retention to 30 days
- Test restore procedure quarterly

### Performance Optimization

**For 500+ users:**
- Enable Prisma Accelerate for connection pooling
- Add Redis for session caching (Upstash free tier)
- Upgrade Neon to Scale plan (autoscaling compute)

**For 1000+ users:**
- Enable CDN for certificate PDFs (Vercel Edge)
- Implement database read replicas
- Consider dedicated Postgres instance

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Certificates not generating**
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is set correctly
- Verify user completed all required modules
- Check database for existing certificate (may already exist)

**Issue: Emails not sending**
- Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is valid
- Check domain verification in Resend dashboard
- Review email logs in database (`EmailLog` table)

**Issue: Cron job not running**
- Verify `CRON_SECRET` matches in code and Vercel environment
- Check Vercel Cron Logs for errors
- Ensure cron path is `/api/cron/expiry-reminders` (not `/api/crons`)

**Issue: Analytics data missing**
- Run `npx prisma db seed` to populate sample data
- Check enrollment status (must be COMPLETED for analytics)
- Verify time range filter in dashboard

### Database Queries (for debugging)

```sql
-- Check certificate issuance
SELECT u.email, c.serial, c.issuedAt, c.expiresAt, c.isActive
FROM "certificates" c
JOIN "enrollments" e ON c."enrollmentId" = e.id
JOIN "users" u ON e."userId" = u.id
ORDER BY c."issuedAt" DESC;

-- Check email logs
SELECT u.email, el."emailType", el."sentAt", el.metadata
FROM "email_logs" el
JOIN "users" u ON el."userId" = u.id
ORDER BY el."sentAt" DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- Check compliance by site
SELECT s.name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT u.id) as total_workers,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN e.status = 'COMPLETED' THEN u.id END) as certified
FROM "sites" s
LEFT JOIN "users" u ON s.id = u."siteId"
LEFT JOIN "enrollments" e ON u.id = e."userId"
GROUP BY s.name;
```
